# Crosswords

Crossword generator(PHP)

Works on 8 internal or user words.

Algorithm: 
- picks words randomly
- tries to fit new word with all placed words starting from the last 
- checks all possible common letters between current 2 words and places with first match
 

NICE TO HAVE: 
- choose best crossword for fe. 10 random generations
- cross edges of word can count as valid (now must be empty)

Comment:
- added some comments to code to make it easier to read
- code needs refactoring to make it easier to understand ... any volunteers? :)
